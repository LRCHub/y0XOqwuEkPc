Everything that I held true has failed me
And nothing is as clear as it once seemed
You have told me who I am and what to do and where to go
I have listened and I' m trapped inside your dream

But I'll take it from here
I'll succeed or I will fail but I will decide
I'll take it from here
Catch my breath and count to ten and
Open my eyes...
Again

My father's plans my mother's fears
My own fine day
Are careening past my reach and my control
You can take your love and keep your money but
Not my will and not my way
At least every mistake will be my own

And I'll take it from here
I'll succeed or I will fail but I will decide
I'll take it from here
Catch my breath and count to ten and
Open my eyes
Open my eyes
Open my eyes

I may not know right now but I will find my way
And I can't wait to see the city when it snows
