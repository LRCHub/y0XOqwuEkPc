[00:07.98] That's the way love goes
[00:10.63] Will it change you inside out
[00:12.38] And then it flows
[00:14.35] To the places unfamiliar, yeah
[00:29.35] 
[00:22.34] Let me tell, I'm not for you
[00:24.38] You're so hot for me
[00:26.67] So get on girl
[00:28.35] Come on (come on, come on, come on)
[00:30.36] I'm hot for you
[00:32.17] You're hot for me
[00:33.36] So get on
[00:35.27] I want to get it on with you
[00:49.27] 
[00:37.82] I'm sending you a message
[00:40.60] I hope you got the sense to read between the lines
[00:44.83] You know that in the book it says that
[00:48.26] For me you never seem to find the time
[00:51.94] Come on I've waited for your phonecalls
[00:55.38] But you must be uptown having fun
[01:00.54] When you do that thing you do
[01:01.93] I get so exited too
[01:04.25] But you never think to ask me if I want to
[01:06.11] Come with you
[01:07.58] So honey where do we go from here?
[01:10.27] You know baby
[01:12.32] I've been trying to find out but I'm still
[01:14.03] Some way from knowing
[01:24.53] 
[01:15.83] You know I am, come on
[01:18.51] It's not exactly clear, no no
[01:21.40] The love you should be giving me
[01:22.72] Is the love you're rarely showing
[01:25.03] That's the way love goes
[01:29.38] That's the way
[01:30.85] That's the way it goes for me and you
[01:34.33] Come on let me tell you now
[01:47.83] 
[01:41.83] I feel you're pushing me out
[01:45.49] Soon I'm gonna lose my patience girl
[01:50.10] Can't understand what you're about
[01:53.20] 'Cause there's no communication
[01:57.44] You say you love to love me, love to love me
[02:01.16] But you always keep your distance
[02:04.97] So honey strike me off your list
[02:06.90] If your love comes with a twist
[02:08.62] 'Cause I want the part that lingered on my lips when we first kissed
[02:42.62] 
[02:13.58] Say do you love me?
[02:15.29] If you do tell me something
[02:18.46] And make it true
[02:20.64] Do you love me
[02:22.44] I need to know!
[02:24.15] Baby can't you tell me where we're gonna go?
[02:46.15] 
[02:28.28] Where do we go from here
[02:29.95] I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing
[02:34.49] It's not exactly clear no no
[02:37.08] The love you should be giving me
[02:38.74] Is the love you're rarely showing
[02:40.87] That's the, that's the way love goes
[02:58.87] 
[02:46.30] And where it's taking us well we don't know
[02:52.97] So let's move straight on ahead
[02:55.48] And tow in the line between us girl
[02:59.12] I think I'd sooner make this love dead!
[03:02.07] Than waste all my time on you, yeah!
[03:04.91] I'm wasting all my time
[03:16.41] 
[03:06.35] I'm gonna learn learn learn
[03:08.84] That's the way love goes
[03:11.55] That's the way
[03:12.68] It's gonna hurt me so bad
[03:14.87] But I won't let it show
[03:17.85] I get the feeling that it's gonna
[03:19.77] Tear out my mind till I can no longer breath
[03:25.77] I know I'm gonna learn learn learn
[03:28.09] That's the way love goes
[03:40.09] 
[03:50.34] Where do we go from here?
[03:52.33] I've been trying to find out but I'm still some way from knowing
[03:57.18] It's not exactly clear
[03:58.86] The love you should be giving me
[04:01.22] Is the love you're rarely showing
[04:03.87] Hey but that's the way love goes yeah
