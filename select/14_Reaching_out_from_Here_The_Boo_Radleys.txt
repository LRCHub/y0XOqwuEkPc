It's not that I am different
It's not that you have changed
This place has done its damage, it's so hard to explain
The sky it bends my back, my crooked shape remains
The gravity's much stronger and nothing here has ever changed

And it looks like another rainy day
Sittin' here lonely by my window, waitin'
For you to come home

I never wanted anything but you alone
But I miss the place that I love,
It's not good enough by phone
This does not feel like home my friends are far away
I get up in the morning and I wait for you all day

But you think it's alright
And they think it's alright
So I guess it's alright too

But I can't stand this place,
I've tried so hard believe me to settle here
Just to have you near, whisper in my ear

That it's gonna be alright
And you're gonna be alright
So I can be alright too
