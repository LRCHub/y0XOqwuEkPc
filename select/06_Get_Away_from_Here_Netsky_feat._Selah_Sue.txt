When you feel in despair
Reflections come to take you right along

To a strange new land
While you're walking through the mirror with me

Lets get away from here

When you feel in despair
Reflections come to take you right along

To a strange new land
While you're walking through the mirror with me

When I feel that I am lost
Once again, reflections come along

To take us by the hand
Let's get away from here
We'll be strong
