I stand before you with open arms
And pray you believe that we'll never part
Tho' time may affect us, in ways we don't realize

I'm here at your side no matter what may come
You're dearest to me, you're my only one
Tho' the world that surrounds us may be constantly
Changing

We are one heart
A melody never ending
Hand in Hand
Heart to Heart
Overcome any sorrow
We believe in tomorrow

I will always
I will always be here, your side
Look where we are – Far beyond the horizon

What more can we say
Nothing can be said
What more must we feel
All our heart's can take
What do we do now
Nothing more can be done
Love has brought us near
Made everything so clear
Where do we go from here

Before you I knew only lonely nights
My distant horizons were cloudy skies
A world that was empty, filled only with darkness

Till you I could offer no reason nor rhyme
Nothing around me was marching in time
I lived in a shadow
There was nothing that gave me light

Now we're here as one
Two hearts beating in harmony
Day and Night
Night and Day
Overcome any sorrow
We believe in tomorrow

I will always
I will always be here, your side

Look where we are
Far beyond the horizon

What more can we say
Nothing can be said
What more must we feel
All our heart's can take
What do we do now
Nothing more can be done
Love has brought us near
Made everything so clear
Where do we go from here

As time passes by I realize
Our love is a gift from the Gods on high
And a love such as ours only happens in paradise

Day and night
Hand in hand
Overcome any sorrow
We believe in tomorrow

I will always
I will always be here, your side

Look where we are
Far beyond the horizon

What more can we say
Nothing can be said
What more must we feel
All our heart's can take

Hand in hand
Heart to heart
Overcome any sorrow
We believe in tomorrow
I will always
That's why I'll always be here, by your side
Look where we are
Far beyond the horizon
What more can we say
Nothing can be said
What more must we feel
All our heart's can take
What do we do now
Nothing more can be done
Love has brought us near
Made everything so clear

Where do we go from here

Ahhh... From here
